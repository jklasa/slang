Custom-made Simple Language (Slang) specification and interpreters

#### Goals
* Experiment with language design, interpreting, and compilation
* Design an interpreted language capable of writing its own interpreter
* Exercise knowledge of computer architecture and low-level languages

#### Non-goals
* Designing a practical or efficient language for any actual use; this is more of a fun side project
